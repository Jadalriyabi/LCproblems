#Should we worry about hits older then 300 seconds? can we get rid of them?

# Should we handle edge cases like no hits or a hit happeneing exactly at the 300-second mark

#can timestamps go beyond 5 minutes

#Optimal Solution

class HitCounter:

        #Weâ€™ll maintain a sliding window of the last 300 seconds, so for each new hit or query, we only need to update a limited range of seconds.
        #Both arrays will be of size 300, since we only care about the last 300 seconds.
        self.hits = [] * 300
